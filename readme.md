## Hi, I'm Drew! 👩‍💻
Hi there! I'm a full-stack software engineer. I have experience in ReactJS (frontend) and Django (backend). ReactJS is a JavaScript framework and Django is a python framework. 

In my free time, I enjoy producing music, hiking and painting 🎨🎮

I have a unique background when it comes to the software field. 
I majored in Psychology with a minor in studio art at Clemson University, and then spent another year and a half working on my BSN at Anderson University. 

I worked as an ER nurse through the pandemic and then transitioned into Psychiatric nursing after college. 

I decided to pivot into tech because I like learning and problem-solving. I also like tinkering and making interesting projects! I'm passionate about making things that make people smile!
